# GUI
## The graphical user interface, or GUI, is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicators

## Parent and Child Relationships
A parent is anything that has objects, like scripts or parts, attached below it. Anything under the parent is its children. In the example shown below, ColorPart is the parent and ColorChangeScript is the child.

## Scripts
Scripts are containers that hold Luau code and can modify the properties and behaviors of other objects.


## Object Properties
Properties control how objects look and function. Each object in Roblox Studio has it's own set of properties. For example, a part object has properties for color, size, and shape. Properties can be changed using the Roblox Studio interface, or through scripts.
